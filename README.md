# The Vigenere Cipher_Program 03
Problem 3 in Assignment 2

# Background Information
Last activity for this output that teach us to exercise complex problems. Moreover, this repository allow us to surf and learn a lot in terms of shortcuts method, tricks, techniques, and accordingly with certain programming language.

# About The Program
The Vigenere Cipher is an encryption and decryption algorithm, because of it is a particular kind of polyalphabetic substitution cipher, the cipher alphabet is frequently altered throughout the encryption process. The cipher becomes less susceptible to cryptanalysis as a result.

# Installation
Gitbash is a great back-up of files, documentation of any of our workloads, it captures the workflow, and the data assurance.
```bash
Install the Gitbash using this link https://git-scm.com/download/win. 
```
# Usage
ciphertext = encrypt(plaintext_input_str, key_input_str)

decrypted_plaintext = decrypt(ciphertext, key_input_str)

# Launch
$ git clone https://github.com/alyj24/decryption_program02.git

$ cd decryption_program02

$ git add -A

$ git commit -m " "

& git push
